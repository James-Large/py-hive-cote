Shapelets univariate
====================

In this folder, there are **three implementations** of shapelets for univariate time series:
<<<<<<< HEAD
        
* shapelets.py:
    * RandomShapeletTransform: Original implementation from [Ye and Keogh] (https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1557122)
    * ContractedRandomShapeletTransform: Adaptation of the original implementation with time_limit
* ShapeletForestClassifier.py: Implemented from [wildboar](https://github.com/isakkarlsson/wildboar).
